#csc401

This course was a practicum taken alongside csc317 (intro to data structures
& algorithms) in spring 2015 with Dr. Odelia Schwartz.

Three projects were completed:
- A greetings generator.
- A number builder: toggle bits to generate a number in base 10.
- A visualization of insertion sort.
